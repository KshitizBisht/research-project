## This file contains all the important topics discussed with Dr Nikos Ntramos

### 29 September 2022
- Brief about the project
- Decided to take more coding approach (most probably scala)
- Task given
    - watch the videos provided
    - How ORC and spark do ACID transaction
    - Make repository
    - Maintain notes/snippets
- Target as of now is to implement ACID transaction on parquet/HBase.

### 4 October 2022

#### What I have done
- Made a repo (containing notes about meeting and research)
- Research about ACID transactions in videos (in progress)
- Revised my big data concept
- Not able to find anything useful about how the implementation is done rather doc shows how to use it
- Took the paper about spark sql and parquet/orc

#### Task
- Check Andy publications
- complete videos 
- read papers.

### 14 October 2022

#### Task given
- Write behind log may not be applied in our case. (still read it)
- Read the paper send by Dr. Nikos
- Go in depth parquet and ORC.
- How ORC can support transactions and why parquet cannot do it yet?
- Hbase or parquet?
- CAP theorem (consistency, availability partition tolerance) Hbase – CP Cassandra – AP
- PACELC (read about this)  
- Look for implementation of parquet and ORC.
